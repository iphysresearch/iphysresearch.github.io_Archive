"pages" and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect. Hope you dig it :) Demo images* courtesy of Unsplash, a radtastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images you can use for pretty much whatever.
